# FlexibleSnowModelOSHD.jl

A Julia implementation of the **Flexible Snow Model (FSM)** for the **Operational Snow Hydrological Service (OSHD)** at SLF. This package provides a comprehensive snow physics model for simulating snow accumulation and melt processes in complex terrain.

## Overview

FlexibleSnowModelOSHD is a multi-layer snow model that simulates:

- **Snow accumulation and ablation** with detailed physics-based processes
- **Multi-layer snow structure** with dynamic layer evolution 
- **Energy balance** including shortwave/longwave radiation, turbulent fluxes, and ground heat transfer
- **Snow hydraulics** with configurable drainage schemes and liquid water retention
- **Forest canopy interactions** including snow interception, unloading, and subcanopy processes
- **Fractional snow cover** using multiple parameterization approaches

The model is designed for operational snow forecasting applications and supports both point-scale and distributed (gridded) simulations across various surface types including open areas, forests, and glaciers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Julia 1.6 or higher
- Required packages are specified in `Project.toml`

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
