# FSMOSHD.jl

A Julia implementation of the **Factorial Snow Model (FSM)** for the **Operational Snow Hydrological Service (OSHD)** at SLF. This package provides a comprehensive snow physics model for simulating snow accumulation and melt processes in complex terrain.

## Overview

FSMOSHD is a multi-layer snow model that simulates:

- **Snow accumulation and ablation** with detailed physics-based processes
- **Multi-layer snow structure** with dynamic layer evolution 
- **Energy balance** including shortwave/longwave radiation, turbulent fluxes, and ground heat transfer
- **Snow hydraulics** with configurable drainage schemes and liquid water retention
- **Forest canopy interactions** including snow interception, unloading, and subcanopy processes
- **Fractional snow cover** using multiple parameterization approaches

The model is designed for operational snow forecasting applications and supports both point-scale and distributed (gridded) simulations across various surface types including open areas, forests, and glaciers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Julia 1.6 or higher
- Required packages are specified in `Project.toml`

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jannefiluren/FSMOSHD
   cd FSMOSHD
   ```

2. **Activate the package environment:**
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.activate(".")
   Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

3. **Load the package:**
   ```julia
   using FSMOSHD
   ```

## Examples

A simulation representing an open site can be run from the terminal by:

```julia
include("script\\run_open_station_example.jl")
```

while a corresponding simulation for a forested site can be run by:

```julia
include("script\\run_forest_station_example.jl")
```

The results from the simulations are stored in the `data/` folder.
