"""
Set up a synthetic snow slide test case on a steep inclined plane with a
cross-slope tilt and a flat run-out zone in the lowest rows. Snow depths are
well above the snow holding depth so that plenty of snow slides, edge pixels
are steep to exercise the edge-dumping branch, deposits trigger the dynamic
reduction of the snow holding depth, and bare pixels in the steep zone receive
deposits that partly re-slide without an underlying snowpack.

With `forest = true`, a forest fraction pattern is added: mostly open pixels,
some partly forested pixels that reduce the slide transfer, pixels above the
50% no-slide threshold, and dense forest. `tiled` sets the tiled trans run
flag, which changes how the forest weighting is applied.

Returns the model `fsm` and its transport workspace `w`.
